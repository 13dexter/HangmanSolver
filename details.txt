Hangman Solver Specifications:

Program running specifications :
	Number of words tested : 50000
	Number of words correctly guessed : 48228
	Accuracy in guessing : 96.456
	Time taken : 33 secs

RAM memory consumed during processing ~ the space all words take to get stores into a vector (for 500000 words ~ 5MB)

Trade Offs : For the maximum possible accuracy (umber of words correctly guessed) had to leave out some other (inevitable by this 				 method).

Assumptions : Duplicates if present (were present in 50000 words) will only occur continuously, i.e. dictionary will be sorted.

To compile the program : (Ubuntu)
g++ -o solver.out solver_hangman.cpp

To run the program with a given dictionary input file (for eg. words_50000.txt) :
./solver.out < words_50000.txt

The spcification data is shown on the termainal (time is in seconds).
The output data for each word guessed (the steps) are printed in a file generated "output.txt".
Search any word in the text file, the steps it took to succeed or fail are shown.
(If failed words are needed to be seen search "Failed");
